- floppy version flickers
- use attached sprites for 4 different frames
- start music, optional ingame music
- insert coin => throws pepper
- remembers previous direction, and if current = previous+another
  then only issue previous

- I would suggest the character to keep moving towards the direction pressed and as soon as they reach a platform that allows left/right to continue to the platform.. in other words there should be no halting on movement while more than one directions are performed on the controller.
- plays good pistorm lite only pi3 issue is after a
  high score is made,. sound issue constant squeel
